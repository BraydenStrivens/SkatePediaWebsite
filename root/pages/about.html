      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated in Spring of 2025 with a degree in Computer Science, and <span>SkatePedia</span> was my project for
        my senior capstone class.
        I have been skateboarding for over ten years and have managed to learn 95 out of the 100 tricks featured in this
        app. I am still
        an inexperienced programmer so if you find any problems with the app or have any ideas to improve it, please
        don't hesitate
        to contact me using either of the contact methods below. Thank you to everyone who downloaded the app and I hope
        it helps you
        learn new tricks!

      <h1>About SkatePedia</h1>
      <p>
        The idea behind SkatePedia comes from my own process for learning new skateboard tricks. I usually
        record myself trying a trick, watch professional skaters doing the same one, and then compare the two to figure
        out what I'm doing wrong. SkatePedia's features are designed to make that process more organized
        and easier to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main feature of SkatePedia is the <b>Trick Item</b>. Trick items allow the user to analyze their tricks and
        track their progress. For each trick in the <b>Trick List</b>, you can
        upload up to 15 trick items. The video in each trick item can be compared with clips of <b>Pro Skaters</b> or
        with
        other trick items of the same trick.
      </p>
      <p>
        The built-in video player lets you slow down playback or go frame-by-frame to help with analysis. You can also
        post your videos to the <b>Community Section</b> to get advice from other users. The app also includes
        <b>Direct Messaging</b> so skaters can chat, share insights, and help each other progress more directly.
      </p>

      <h1>Trick List</h1>
      <p>
        I decided to base the app on a standardized list of 25 fundamental trick combinations, ranging from beginner to
        advanced. A separate trick list is provided for each stance — regular, fakie, switch, and nollie. Users can also
        add other tricks they want to learn, though pro videos won't be available for those. To simplify the UI,
        users can remove any tricks they're not interested in learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since skateboarding doesn't have an official governing body to define or standardize trick names, there can be
        some inconsistencies in terminology. I wanted to minimize confusion about how tricks are labeled in the app. One
        common source of mix-ups is the naming of fakie and nollie tricks: for example, a regular frontside flip done
        fakie is called a fakie frontside flip, but the same trick done nollie is called a nollie backside flip. In
        other words, “frontside” and “backside” are reversed for nollie tricks — and that's the convention I've followed
        in naming them within the app.
      </p>

      <h1>Trick Items</h1>
      <p>
        Trick Items include a video of the user performing a trick, notes on areas for improvement,
        and a satisfaction rating from 1 to 3. Each video can be compared with footage of professional 
        skaters performing the same trick, as well as with other trick items for the same trick. 
        Users can update their notes based on insights gained from analyzing their videos.
      </p>

      <h1>Pro Skateboarders</h1>
      <p>
        The videos of professional skateboarders was found mostly from Battle at the Berrics games of S.K.A.T.E as well as 
        Instagram and video parts. Considering the way to win a game of S.K.A.T.E is to do tricks your opponent can't do,
        I was unable to find pro videos for some of the beginner tricks as well as some of the rarely done tricks.
